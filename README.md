1 ** **Overview of the Project****/

In this Project we have given an election data by analyzing this data we should :


1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Calculate the total number of votes each county received.
7. Determine which county got largest number of votes.

3.  ** **Election Audit Summary ** **

Just with 3 information (Ballot ID, County Name, Candidate Name) alone we could do multiple analysis, as we have done above. I would add the following two additional modification to the data set, which will enable more analysis options across states in our country and within a county.

1) Provide the state information within this file (or as a master file connecting the state and counties) would help us to use this analysis with mimimal modification to use across states.

2) If we can add the voting station details into this file, then we can even analyse the voting percentage for each voting station within a county.
